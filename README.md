# Go With Tests
Need to do React unit test and component testing at work. Kinda boring and I lost interest. I guess I need to explore something else after work. Golang has a special place in my heart. It's the first programming language I learnt during my internship. The language has a high learning curve, but the syntax was very elegant and minimalistic. Wanted to give it a "go" again, hopefully it can spark âœ¨ my interest. So I googled for some Go tutorials and stumbled on a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/t8owza/best_go_tutorials_in_town/) post. There's bunch of cool resources and I decided to choose "Learn Go with Tests". Usually I learn coding tutorial from Youtube videos. But this tutorial is in the form of something of like an ebook. Looks interesting. Let's see how it goes. It's not React, but maybe I can learn TDD in a different perspective.
